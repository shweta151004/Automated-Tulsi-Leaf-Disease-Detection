# Automated-Tulsi-Leaf-Disease-Detection
Early and accurate detection of diseases in Tulsi (Ocimum tenuiflorum) is vital for maintaining yield and medicinal quality. This project proposes an automated leaf disease detection system using a CNN with transfer learning. MobileNetV2 was fine-tuned on 2,274 images across four classes, achieving 91.6% validation accuracy for smart agriculture .

This project successfully developed an automated system for Tulsi leaf disease 
detection using transfer learning with MobileNetV2 architecture. The model 
effectively classified leaves into four categories - healthy, bacterial, fungal, and 
pest-affected - achieving a remarkable validation accuracy of 91.6%. This 
represents a significant 16.6% improvement over previous Tulsi-specific 
research, demonstrating the efficacy of transfer learning for agricultural 
applications with limited datasets. 
The implemented two-phase training strategy, combining initial feature 
extraction with subsequent fine-tuning, proved highly effective in adapting pre
trained knowledge to the specialized domain of plant pathology. Despite 
challenges in fungal infection detection, the system showed exceptional 
performance in identifying pest damage and bacterial infections, making it 
immediately valuable for practical agricultural use. 
This work bridges the gap between advanced deep learning techniques and 
traditional agricultural practices, offering a scalable solution that can empower 
farmers, enhance crop management, and support the growing herbal medicine 
industry. The project establishes a strong foundation for future research in AI
driven plant disease detection while providing immediate practical benefits for 
sustainable agriculture and medicinal plant conservation.
